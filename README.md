# Password Generator
It was made to practice and show off my skills with JavaScript
## Description

- My motivation for this project was to be more effective with JavaScript. JavaScript has been difficult to understand and I had a lot of help from tutors, classmates, and the instructor.    
- I built this project, because I wanted to see what I could do myself and see if I would be able to understand JavaScript
- This project gives me the ability to randomly generator a password with just a click of a button. 
- I learned that having a really good psuedo code can really help you setup and stay on task.

I really struggled on this assignment. I wasn't able to get it the project to full work. When I tried to get it to verify it kept coming up false and wouldn't go anything further.
